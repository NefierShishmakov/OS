SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>
       unsigned int sleep(unsigned int seconds);

DESCRIPTION
       sleep()  causes the calling thread to sleep either until the number of 
       real-time seconds specified in seconds have elapsed or
       until a signal arrives which is not ignored.

RETURN VALUE
       Zero if the requested time has elapsed, or the number of seconds left to sleep, 
       if the call was interrupted by a signal  handler.
